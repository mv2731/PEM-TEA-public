# PEM-TEA-private
Techno-economic analysis for proton exchange membranes. Private repo. 

In this README, we can add a description of the project or any project updates. In software engineering projects the README file typically serves as centralized documentation for the project. 

We can also create different branches depending on if we want to explore two different options from the same state of the code. Ie, if I wanted to compare whether factoring in degradation or factoring in renewable curtailment made more of a difference to our pricing, I could create two branches and work on implementing each in one branch.  

History on the upper left displays the commits made to a repository, and history is unique to each branch.
